Hi! I'm Om Nom (she/her), a transgender programmer going into Computer Engineering at Concordia University. Most of my projects have revolved around functional programming, such as my LISP dialect [deeprose](https://github.com/omnomctr/deeprose3) and my lambda calculus interpreter [lc](https://github.com/omnomctr/lc). Currently I mostly specialize in compilers and interpreters, usually written in C or Rust.
